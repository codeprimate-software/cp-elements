## Codeprimate Elements

Codeprimate Elements (codename *cp-elements*, pronounced *see-pee elements*, or just *Elements*) is a Java class library
and micro-framework simplifying the development of software applications written in Java.

Elements packages several APIs handling different application concerns and aspects, such as configuration, management,
security, data modeling/processing along with the encapsulation of business logic into functional-based rules.
At the most basic, fundamental level, Elements is an extension of the Java language and APIs itself, adding powerful
and expressive capabilities not directly provided by the Java Platform.

The intent of Elements is to provide high quality, reusable and useful application classes and components that solve
common, reoccurring problems during application development.

The objective of *cp-elements* is to provide...

1. Simple, robust and proven APIs built on solid OO principles, design patterns, and best practices...
2. Following "open" standards where applicable...
3. With zero dependencies on 3rd party APIs and frameworks.

#### Why Elements...

When the likes of Apache Commons or Google Guava exist?  Elements is a highly refined library of classes and components
based on years of research and development and extensive experience in deployed enterprise applications.
Elements maintains a high standard on quality backed by extensive test coverage, peer review and is proven and trusted
in many contexts.
