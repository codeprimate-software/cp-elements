## Codeprimate Elements

Codeprimate Elements (a.k.a. *cp-elements*, pronounced *see-pee elements*, or just *Elements*) is a Java Class Library
(JCL) and micro-framework for simplifying the development of software applications using the Java SE Platform.

Elements packages several APIs, each handling different application concerns and aspects, such as configuration,
management, data modeling and processing, and the encapsulation of business logic into functional-based rules.
At the most basic, fundamental level, Elements is an extension of the Java language and APIs itself, adding
capabilities not directly provided by the Java Platform.

The intent of Elements is to provide high quality reusable and expressive application classes and components
that solve common, reoccurring problems in application development using...

1. Simple, robust APIs built on proven OO principles, design patterns, and best practices...
2. Adhering to "open" standards where applicable...
3. With zero dependencies on 3rd party APIs and frameworks.

#### Why Elements...

When the likes of Apache Commons and Google Guava exist?  Elements is a highly refined library of classes and components
based on years of research and development and extensive use in deployed enterprise applications.  Elements maintains
a high standard for quality backed by extensive test coverage, proven and trusted in many contexts.
