## Codeprimate Elements 

*Codeprimate Elements* (a.k.a. *cp-elements* pronounced *see-pee elements*, or just *Elements*) is a Java library
and micro-framework for simplifying the development of software applications written in **Java**. 

*Elements* packages several APIs handling different application concerns and aspects, such as configuration, management,
 security, data modeling/processing along with the encapsulation of business logic into functional-based rules.
 At the most basic/fundamental level, *Elements* is an extension of the Java language and APIs itself adding powerful
 and expressive capabilities not directly provided by the **Java Platform**. 

The intent of *Elements* is to provide high quality, reusable and useful application classes and components that solve 
common, reoccurring problems during software development.

#### Elemental Objectives  

1. Functionally independent with no dependencies on 3rd-party Java libraries.
2. Simple, robust and proven APIs built on solid OO principles, design patterns, and best practices.
3. Promote collaboration through "open", transparent communication and feedback.
4. With priority on quality (over quantity) and reliability.  

#### Why Elements...  

When the likes of *Apache Commons* or *Google Guava* exist?

  *Elements* is a highly refined Java library of classes and components based on years of research and development
along with  extensive experience in deployed enterprise applications. *Elements* maintains a high standard on quality
enforced by extensive test coverage, code metrics, peer review and trusted performance in extreme enterprise
application environments.

  *Elements* is a foundational Java library, and does not introduce any additional dependencies in order to function
or perform  properly out-of-the-box.  Good [Object-Oriented Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design)
 based on [SOLID design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) coupled with
 effective use of [Software Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) makes *Elements*
 immediately familiar, highly consistent and easy to use.  Finally, development of *Elements* consists of open,
 transparent collaboration and feedback that is essential to building high quality and reliable software.
