/**
 * The Elements {@literal beans} package is an extension of the JavaBeans API providing useful and convenient features
 * and capabilities not present in the JavaBeans API.
 *
 * The {@link org.cp.elements.beans.AbstractBean} class enables application domain model classes and types to be
 * identified, audited, constrain properties and emit events.
 *
 * Additionally, the {@link org.cp.elements.beans.model.BeanAdapter} and {@link org.cp.elements.beans.model.BeanModel}
 * classes can be used to perform much more fine-grained and sophisticated property value evaluations, such as
 * constraining properties via accessor annotations.
