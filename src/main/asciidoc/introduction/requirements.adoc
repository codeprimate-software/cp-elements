_Elements_ only requires the *Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 8.0* or later to run correctly. No other dependencies
are required.

_Elements_ is specifically built with _Oracle_, *Java SE SDK 8 (1.8.0_351)*.

_Elements_ is also built with *Java 11*, *Java 14*, *Java 17* and *Java 18*. Therefore, _Elements_ will function
and run perfectly fine on all of these Java versions as well.
